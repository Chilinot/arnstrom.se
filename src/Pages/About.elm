### About
I'm a DevOps engineer working within VoIP communication and web development, currently employed by [Bahnhof](https://bahnhof.se) which is a Swedish ISP and ITSP focused on privacy and security.

My line of work includes full stack web development, [Docker](https://docker.com) & [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) architecture and administration. I also work with designing, building, and maintaining VoIP communication systems for the ITSP using [OpenSIPS](https://opensips.org), [Asterisk](https://asterisk.org), and various other technologies.

Working on awesome projects is both my hobby and my line of work.
